# Scientific Data Analysis Workshops (Binder-ready)

This repository was developed as an educational tutorial/workshop for the Scientific Data Analysis course (6003ESC) offered to Honours students at Griffith University. The tutorials cover basic/intermediate data analysis and visualisation in R using `tidyverse` approach, as well as basic statistics.  
The teaching material for workshops 1-3 is developed by Dr. Ido Bar (i.bar@griffith.edu.au) and is loosely based on Software Carpentry teaching material and other online resources. Workshops 4-5 were developed by Dr. James McBroom (j.mcbroom@griffith.edu.au).  
The tutorials are setup to be run live and interactively in class either setup locally on the students' computers or using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/){target="_blank"} (see instructions below).

## Instructions 
Launch Binder with this repository by clicking on this badge - [![Launch Rstudio Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/IdoBar/6003ESC_workshops_binder/main?urlpath=rstudio){target="_blank"}, then navigate the folder that contains the data and tutorial (in HTML format) for each week. All required packages and data files are "bound" in the repository and the students can start working straight away.
